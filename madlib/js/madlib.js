var story = `The two ${noun1} and the small boy stood absolutely still on the grass underneath the tree, gazing up at this extraordinary ${noun2}. James's little face was glowing with excitement, his eyes were as big and bright as ${number1} ${noun3}. He could see the ${noun2} swelling larger and larger as clearly as if it were a balloon being blown up. In half a ${unitOfTime1}, it was the size of a melon! In another half-${unitOfTime2}, it was twice as big again! 
"Just look at it ${verbPresent}!" Aunt Spiker cried.
"Will it ever stop!" Aunt Sponge shouted, waving her ${adjective1}
arms and starting to ${verb1} around in circles.
And now it was so ${adjective2} it looked like an enormous buttercolored
${noun4} dangling from the top of the tree.
"Get away from that tree trunk, you ${adjective3} ${noun5}!" Aunt
Spiker yelled. "The slightest shake and I'm sure it'll ${verb2} off! It
must weigh ${number2} or ${number3} ${unitOfMeasure1} at least!"
The branch that the ${noun2} was ${verbPresent} upon was
beginning to bend over further and further because of the
weight.
"Standback!" Aunt Sponge shouted. "It's coming down!
The branch is going to break!"
But the branch didn't break. It simply bent over more and
more as the ${noun2} got heavier and heavier.
And still it went on ${verbPresent}.
In another minute, this mammoth ${noun2} was as ${adjective4} and
${adjective5} and ${adjective6} as Aunt Sponge herself, and probably just as
heavy.
"It has to stop now!" Aunt Spiker yelled. "It can't go on
forever!"
But it didn't stop.`
